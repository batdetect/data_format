# Meta Data Creation

Here we generate a single meta data file that contains information about the taxa, licenses, and call types.  

Running `create_metadata.py` will generate the json file called `bat_metadata.json`. This will take several minutes.

Version 1.0 contains a list of 1423 species, with 210 associated genera. The full list can be viewed [here](list_of_bats.md).
